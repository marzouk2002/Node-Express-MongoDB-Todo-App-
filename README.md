#Node Express MongoDB Todo App

As the title says, this is a todo app built using Node, Express, MongoDB.
I cloned the initial code from Github because I'm interested in learning the back-end for now.
And to be more precise, how to hook node and express with a MongoDB Database using mongoose. And that is what I worked on in this project.
